# 🚀 Project Kickoff: AltQ Internship Program

**Welcome aboard!**  
We are excited to have you join AltQ.in for this 1-month intensive sprint. This document outlines how we will work together, your environment, and what success looks like.

## 1. The Mission: "Building Reputation"
At AltQ, our core product solves the "Queue" problem. But once the service is done, we have a blind spot: **We don't know if the customer was happy.**

Your mission is to build the **"Reputation Module"**—a system that closes this loop. This isn't just a "practice project"; it is a prototype for a feature we intend to roll out to real salons.

## 2. Your Work Environment: "The Sandbox"
To give you maximum freedom (and speed) without breaking our live servers, you will work in an **Isolated Sandbox Environment**.

*   **What this means:** You are the "CTO" of your own repo. You can choose your folder structure, break things, and fix them without fear of taking down the main app.
*   **The Guardrails:**
    *   **Repo:** Dedicated GitHub Repository (Invite sent).
    *   **Database:** You will spin up your own MongoDB instance.
    *   **deployment:** You have full ownership to deploy this to a free tier (Vercel/Render) for your final demo.

---

## 3. Communication & Logistics
*   **Duration:** [Start Date] to [End Date].
*   **Working Hours:** Flexible/Async. We care about **Output**, not hours.
*   **Core Communication:**
    *   **Questions:** WhatsApp/Slack (Expect reply within 4 hours).
    *   **Code Review:** GitHub Pull Requests (Weekly).
    *   **Sync Call:** Every **[Day of Week] at [Time]** (30 mins).

## 4. The "Definition of Done"
We treat this internship seriously. For a task to be "Complete," it must be:
1.  **Committed:** Pushed to the `main` branch.
2.  **Working:** Running live on your deployment URL.
3.  **Clean:** No console errors or linting warnings.
